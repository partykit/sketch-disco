        Flint was formed in soft, limy mud on the floor of the Chalk Sea some 80 million years ago. It is made of quartz, or silica, which came from the skeletons of tiny sponges that lived in this tropical sea. Their skeletons were dissolved in the seawater and therefore the mud on the sea floor contained silica in small amounts. … Some flint beds can be traced for hundreds of kilometres.

        The bizarre shapes of flint nodules, with spiky protrusions and holes, are thought to be due to flint replacing the chalk in the burrows of marine animals such as arthropods that were living beneath the Chalk Sea floor, and it was this connection with burrows that proved to be the key to how flint was formed. The process of flint formation was originally the subject of much argument and was only finally worked out in the 1980s when it was established that flint formed preferentially in burrows due to the presence of decaying organic matter, and also at the ‘redox boundary’, below which anaerobic, sulphate-reducing bacteria predominate. The shape of a flint nodule is therefore often the shape of an animal’s burrow, with the surface often showing the burrowed fabric of the chalk it has replaced.
